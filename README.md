SO WLCOME BACK GUYS HER I'M TO SHOW YOU ONE OF MY SHITTY CREATION AGAIN.........
HaHa.... 
Hi.. 
have a great days !!
hope you guys will hit something super soon !!

#  USAGE:

usage: kangrip.py [-h] -f FILE [-R] [-S] [-k KANGAROOS] [-s START] [-e END] [-o OUTPUT] [-r]

Kangaroo algorithm with RIPEMD-160 hash matching.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  Path to the file containing target RIPEMD-160 hashes
  -R, --random          Enable random mode for private key generation
  -S, --sequence        Enable sequence mode for private key generation
  -k KANGAROOS, --kangaroos KANGAROOS
                        Number of kangaroos to launch within the range
  -s START, --start START
                        Starting key for sequential scan
  -e END, --end END     Ending key for the scan range
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output file to store found private keys
  -r, --reverse         Enable reverse scan direction

# STILL ERRORS WHYYY?? 

1. Its error less and the main thing we are suffering from that it goes for decimal units instead of hexadecimmal shit....

2. speed is super slow but in theoryy of computing logicss......
   
   > if you use -k 1 the speed will be same as - k2,3,4,5.... (whatever)
   > 
   > also according to the theory :
   > 
   > if -k 100 is used = 7000 then the kang speed will be about 100kangs x speed of one kang = 70000 kngs

   > speed will simultaneously decrease after every kang end the range

4. multiple kangaroos for RIPMD160 is slowing it i need you guys to make it even more correct.....

# kangrip.py ?? 

+ this is the best ever coded code and its completely done with logics  
already ecplained in the begning 

+ use it goo bross

# kangrip1.py
see in the picture : it was the base version of making this thing

# kangrip2.py
!!! its the developing module from the scratch not for use !!!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0451b97e-c0f4-438f-ad3b-351d2b7858e2)


# kangrip3.py
!!! its nothing for use dont use this crap !!!

# why we are here?? and how its workk?

hmmmm its a program which i created a long ago (1month agoo) the thing is kangaroooo in everyy kngaroo its only 2 kangarooo but for now there will be more

but not for public keys bcz keys are limited

so,  we are booming for RIPEMD-160 HASHES

i created used and checked everything not found anything so thought it might help u guy
here wee got kangrooo algorithm:
1. A  algorithm in which kangaroo hop in each range with different number of steps....
   
> so if kang 1 is form 10 steps kang2 is from 100 steps
> 
> why cant we load a table with unlimited kanagrooos??????????????/
> 
> the ques answers is yes   so the thing is liike :
>
>  🐇..........................🐇 real kang wild and tame
> 
AND MY SCRIPT DO THIS:
> 🐇.....................🐇.......🐇...🐇🐇....🐇.......🐇........🐇🐇
> you are brusting of the table with the huge amount of kangarooos within the range which is equally dstributed  depends on -k factor
>

[im not using it bcz of 6k to 10k speed with 2 gb of database match sooo better to go with keyhunt if yo guys think its dead script]
