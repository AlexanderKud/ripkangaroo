SO WLCOME BACK GUYS HER I'M TO SHOW YOU ONE OF MY SHITTY CREATION AGAIN.........
HaHa.... 
Hi.. 
have a great days !!
hope you guys will hit something supwe soon !!

#  USAGE:

[usage: kangrip.py [-h] -f FILE [-R] [-S] [-k KANGAROOS] [-s START] [-e END] [-o OUTPUT] [-r]

Kangaroo algorithm with RIPEMD-160 hash matching.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  Path to the file containing target RIPEMD-160 hashes
  -R, --random          Enable random mode for private key generation
  -S, --sequence        Enable sequence mode for private key generation
  -k KANGAROOS, --kangaroos KANGAROOS
                        Number of kangaroos to launch within the range
  -s START, --start START
                        Starting key for sequential scan
  -e END, --end END     Ending key for the scan range
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output file to store found private keys
  -r, --reverse         Enable reverse scan direction]

# STILL ERRORS WHYYY?? 

1. Its error less and the main thing we are suffering from that it goes for decimal units instead of hexadecimmal shit....

2. speed is super slow but in theoryy of computing logicss......
   > if you use -k 1 the speed will be same as - k2,3,4,5.... (whatever)
   > also according to the theory :
   > if -k 100 is used = 7000 then the kang speed will be about 100kangs x speed of one kang = 7000 kngs
   > HURRAYYY!!!!!
   > but its not compatible upto 2 gb of data file...........
   > speed will simultaneously decrease after every kang end the range

3. multiple kangaroos for RIPMD160 is slowing it i need you guys to make it even more correct.....

# kangrip.py ?? 

+ this is the best ever coded code and its completely done with logics  
already ecplained in the begning 

+ use it goo bross

# kangrip2.py
